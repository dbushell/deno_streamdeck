# ðŸ¦• Deno Stream Deck

Deno library for Stream Deck. The Elgato USB device (not the Steam Deck gaming thing).

Built with [Deno USB HID API](https://github.com/dbushell/deno_usbhidapi). See requirements for the HIDAPI dynamic library.

## Supported devices

I've only tested the **Stream Deck MK.2**. I have no plans to test other devices unless you'd like to buy me one! The XL should work. Device info for the Original and Mini is provided but they require Bitmap in place of JPEG.

## Resources

* [Deno USB HID API](https://github.com/dbushell/deno_usbhidapi) â€” my generic base library.
* [Python Elgato Stream Deck Library](https://github.com/abcminiuser/python-elgato-streamdeck/) â€” original inspiration for this project.
